This web map references the live tiled map service from the <a href=http://www.openstreetmap.org target="_blank">OpenStreetMap  (OSM)</a> project. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open collaborative project to  create a free editable 
<a href="link.html#info">map</a>
 of the world. Volunteers gather location data  using GPS, local knowledge, and other free sources of information and upload it. </p>
<br><br><br>

The resulting free map can be  viewed and downloaded from the OpenStreetMap server: http://www.OpenStreetMap.org.  See that website for additional information about OpenStreetMap. It is made available as a basemap for GIS work in ESRI products under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.

<h1>Surveys and personal knowledge</h1>
Surveying routes with a GPS receiver
Ground surveys are performed by a mapper, on foot, bicycle, or in a car, motorcycle or boat. Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.<br><br>
Once the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website. At that point, no information about the kind of uploaded track is available â€“ it could be e.g., a motorway, a footpath, or a river. Thus, in a second step, editing takes place using one of several purpose-built map editors (e.g., JOSM). This is usually done by the same mapper, sometimes by other contributors registered at OpenStreetMap.<br><br>
As collecting
<a href="link1.html#importing">back to top </a>and uploading data is separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible also without using a GPS unit. In particular, placing and editing objects such as schools, hospitals, taxi ranks, bus stops, pubs, etc. is done based on editors' local knowledge.<br><br>
Some committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.<br><br>
<p id=info>
Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database.
