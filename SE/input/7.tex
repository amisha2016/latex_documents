\subsection*{Analysis}
In computer programming, testing is a software method by which
individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program
modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and
operating procedures are tested to determine if they are fit for use.
Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an
application. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire
module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.
In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface,
such as a class, but could be an individual method. Unit tests are
short code fragments created by programmers or occasionally by white
box testers during the development process. Ideally, each test case is
independent from the others. Substitutes such as method stubs, mock
objects, fakes, and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a
module in isolation. Unit tests are typically written and run by
software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves
as intended.

\subsection*{Testing}

Testing a program consists of providing the program with a set of test inputs (or test cases) and
observing if the program behaves as expected. If the program fails to behave as expected, then the
conditions under which failure occurs are noted for later debugging and correction. 


This software had been taken through rigorous test to fully found potential causes of error and system failure
and full focus have been given to cover all possible exceptions that can 
occur and cause failure of the software.
As this software is based on intensive background process it have been taken care that 
if correct input and email address are given then processing of user job can even continue or a least automatically 
restart even after server shuts down or even crash.
